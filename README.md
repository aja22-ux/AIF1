# üß¨ Allograft Inflammatory Factor-1 (AIF1)

> **The Little Protein with a Big Impact**

Welcome! This site explores the structure and function of **Allograft Inflammatory Factor-1**, an actin-binding protein involved in inflammation, tissue repair, and graft rejection.

---

## Expression & Role in the Body

AIF1 is expressed primarily in:

- Activated macrophages  
- Microglia in the brain  
- Spleen and lymph nodes  

Low in resting macrophages, but **highly upregulated during immune activation and transplant rejection**.

## üß© Protein Structure

We‚Äôve included three PDB structures of AIF1:

- [PDB ID 4X3A](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4X3A) ‚Äì actin-bound conformation  
- [PDB ID 2LKM](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/2LKM) ‚Äì solution NMR structure of AIF1 domain  
- [PDB ID 7D1E](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/7D1E) ‚Äì ligand-bound homolog  

You can rotate these models live on the RCSB site or embed them in the HTML version of this site.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Mechanism & Disease Links

AIF1 binds actin filaments to regulate macrophage migration and cytoskeletal dynamics.  
Overexpression is linked to:

- Chronic inflammation  
- Transplant rejection  
- Neuroinflammatory diseases  

Blocking AIF1‚Äôs actin-binding site is a potential therapeutic approach.
